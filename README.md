I'm currently working on Mech, a language for developing **data-driven**, **reactive** systems like animations, games, and robots. It makes **composing**, **transforming**, and **distributing** data easy, allowing you to focus on the essential complexity of your project. Learn more about it here: https://github.com/mech-lang/mech
